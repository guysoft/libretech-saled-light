# WS2812 LED

# Protocol

* 50us reset
* 800k ws2812 codes / sec
* 24 ws2812 codes / led
* 30us / led
* 3 bits / ws2812 code
* 2.4m bit / second
* 72 bit / led
* 9 byte / led

# Refresh Rate

* frame time = 50us + leds * 30us
* 300 leds = 0.00905 second frame time
* frame per second = 1 / (50us + leds * 30us)
* 300 leds = 110 frames per second
* leds = (1 / fps - 50us) / 30us
* 30 fps = 1109 leds
* 60 fps = 554 leds

# Considerations

* 50us * 2.4m bit / sec = 120 bits
* 120 bits / 24 bits per led = 5 leds
